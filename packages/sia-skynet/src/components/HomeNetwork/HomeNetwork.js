                Skynet Webportal is a low cost server that sits between Skynet
                and everyday users, enabling them to access Skynet content
                without needing to operate any special software. Once the
                Skylinks are generated, they can be shared with anyone to fetch
                data from Skynet. The original uploader does not need to stay
                online in order for the file to remain available. The Sia
                network handles all of the pinning, guaranteeing both high
                speeds and excellent uptime. A typical Skynet download starts in
                under 500 milliseconds and can stream at rates as high as 1
                gigabit per second. The Sia network serves as the backend
                storage layer for Skynet.

                Sia is the leading decentralized cloud storage platform. No
                signups, no servers, no trusted third parties. Sia leverages
                blockchain technology to create a data storage marketplace that
                is more robust and more affordable than traditional cloud
                storage providers. Storage costs are as much as 10x lower than
                traditional infrastructure, bandwidth costs as much as 100x
                lower, all without sacrificing performance or reliability.
